  <div class="scores-copy"><b>Very good</b> - Expect a place with the maximum score to take food safety seriously: all materials and surfaces are clean and in good condition, procedures are in place to prevent cross-contamination between raw and cooked foods, and there will be clear instructions on how to disinfect work surfaces and how to store food. Staff will be properly trained and all records up to date.</div>

  <div class="scores-number-fail">2</div>
  <div class="scores-copy"><b>Improvement necessary</b> - A score of two might indicate that the storage and preparation area for food is in a poor state of repair, with kitchen floors, walls or ceilings needing replacing. Also cleaning standards might need improvement, and the premises might be failing in areas such as inadequate procedures for cooling cooked foods, as well as some records missing or incomplete.</div>

  <div class="scores-number-fail">1</div>
  <div class="scores-copy"><b>Much improvement necessary</b> - A premises might get a score of one for cross-contamination of raw and cooked food, having a hand basin that is difficult to access, the kitchen requiring more cleaning, having inadequate records and having staff not trained in food safety.</div>

<div class="scores">
  <div class="scores-number-fail">0</div>
  <div class="scores-copy"><b>Urgent improvement necessary</b> - A premises gets a score of zero if it raises enough concerns on issues of structure, hygiene and management. All of the concerns raised above, plus not having adequate systems in place, such as staff training and procedures for monitoring cleaning and temperatures. A pest infestation, particularly if mice, rats or cockroaches come into contact with food or where there is no evidence of management investing in pest control, will lead to a score of zero and probably result in the premises being shut down while it deals with the problem.</div>
